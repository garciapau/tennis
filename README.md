# The Tennis Kata
Tennis is a ball and racket sport that is scored in an interesting way. The scoring system of a tennis match is based on points, games and sets. We will focus on the scoring of points inside a single game for the scope of this exercise, leaving explicitly out the set & match management. 
The rules that we want you to consider are the ones found in the section “Game Score” of the wikipedia page of Tennis Scoring System (excluding the tie-break, which is also out of the scope of this exercise)
